    "It is not possible to build a neural network that computes the XOR function. In order to compute this function, it needs to be able to use the linear AND and OR functions together to only accept inputs were one is true and the other isn't instead of also accepting the case when both are true. This requires that the activation function be non-linear, and it would also require back-propogation where it could feed errors back through the system and learn from that. Without these two qualifications, it isn't possible to build a neural network that computes the XOR function because it is not a linear problem."
