EXERCISE 7.2

a. Categorical data is data that is described by words (categories – could sometimes be numbers treated as categoies) whereas numerical data is purely numbers (intended to be used as numbers).

b. 

Task #1

train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00003,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=4
)
Final RMSE (on training data): 178.11

Task #2

train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00003,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=4,
    input_feature="population"
)
Final RMSE (on training data): 177.27

c. The hyper-parameters in this case are the learning rate, steps, batch size, and input feature. There is no “standard” tuning algorithm for these hyper-parameters since it all depends on the data.
