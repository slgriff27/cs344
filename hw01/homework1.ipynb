    "This topic of introspection is difficult to apply in AI especially since there is no set science of how it is done with humans. Introspection is where humans examine their own minds without outside influence. On the one hand, humans are shaped by outside influences from the time that they were born, so the thoughts they have at any point in their life, even simply within their own minds, are still influenced by their experience with the outside world. This can be seen the same way inside of machines – everything they “know” has been influenced by the outside world (humans programming them, the internet, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the definition of introspection includes two words that are often discounted when it comes to machines – consciousness and feelings. It is the examination of one’s own conscious thoughts and feelings. Humans are conscious, but machines are not. Humans can have feelings, but machines cannot. Consequently, is it possible for machines to practice introspection if they do not even possess the very principles it is based upon? I do not think this is possible, however, I do think that programming machines to learn from their “experiences in this world” is quite possible and prove to be much more efficient. I would call this process machine learning, though, rather than introspection.\n"
