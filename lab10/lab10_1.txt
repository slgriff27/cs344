a. I think at this stage in my learning process, I would rather use Keras to build my models. Keras is built on top of Tensorflow, so it is similar, but a little different. Keras helps you build models easily with the fewest lines of code, whereas it takes longer to build a model using Tensorflow. However, Tensorflow is much better for customizing the code to do what you want. This is better for more advanced programmers than I, so Keras is a better option for me at this point.

Task #1
These were the best results I could get. It wasn’t quite below 110, but it was pretty close.

learning_rate=0.003,
steps=1300,
batch_size=150,
hidden_units=[11, 9],
Final RMSE (on training data):   111.23
Final RMSE (on validation data): 110.15

Task #2
Final RMSE (on test data): 118.45
