This example is based around the IMDB movie reviews dataset, and it does a binary classification, deciding whether each review is positive or negative. In this example, they use Keras, so I will be using Keras as well seeing that I am modelling my project off of this chapter. Keras is higher level and easier to use than Tensor Flow as well, so I would like to use this technology since the project is not necessarily advanced enough to be utilizing the customization that Tensor Flow offers.",

      "source": "My implementation of this project is going to be based on the example listed above, so I will continue to explain how that project was implemented. In this example, the movie reviews have been preprocessed so that they are already converted from a sequence of words into a sequence of integers since words cannot be processed by the system. As usual, they use a training and a testing set to train the model and prevent overfitting. The datasets are all integers after they have been converted from words, but a neural network cannot take a list of integers. Consequently, they use one-hot encoding on the lists by turning them all into vectors made up of ones and zeros. For example, a sequence of [3,5] would become all zeros except the ones in the indices 3 and 5. The architecture they use has two intermediate layers with 16 hidden units each, and a third layer which outputs the scalar prediction (0 for negative, 1 for positive). The intermediate layers’s activation function is “relu,” and the final layer uses a sigmoid activation to output a probability (a score between 0 and 1, indicating how likely the sample is to have the target \"1\", i.e. how likely the review is to be positive). They also use the binary crossentropy loss function, since the model they are using outputs probabilities.",

The project above explained how to do this in terms of sentiment analysis with the IMDB database, and I will be using the same tactics plus allowing a third option (positive, neutral, and negative) unlike the example model. Having three categories makes the ratings more reliable. I do not think it is wrong in any way to base what you buy off of reviews of that product. In fact, it is probably a very wise idea so that you don’t waste time and money ordering what you do not necessarily need. That is why this project matters.\n",
